# Undermine-Bingo-Generator
A few things:
    Issues:
        Currently some text editing is needed in order for the json output to actually work, this needs looking into.
        Needs thorough testing to ensure it always spits out the right number of goals, sofar it does but needs checking anyway.
        Some goals currently included might need adjustment, this is going to need actual playtesting.
    How to:
        bingosync.com is the website used for the setup, but there is a small specific thing needed to actually use the output json.
        Game should be set to custom(advanced), there is NO Undermine category.
        Just run the .py and paste the output in the json file, you will currently need to do some text finagling to get this to work but I want to fix that.
    If you want to add custom goals, MAKE SURE EVERY TIER HAS THE SAME NUMBER OF GOALS OTHERWISE YOU WILL END UP WITH BLANK GOALS
    Currently has 20 of each tier, you can change these in the .csv file with ease in Excel or a similar program. If you want to change the ratio of Easy:Medium:Hard Goals, change the numbers at the top of the .py file that correspond to E, M, and H.
    If anything breaks or you aren't sure what to do dm me in Discord @Jaimses6969

Bingo Rules:
    1.New save only, no using previously active saves.
    2.Lockout or Non-Lockout, either works.
    3.For the familiar skin goal, if the WHIP is deemed to difficult by every player then it can be      considered a free space for BOTH parties. Toss a coin in lockout.
    4.First to fill a row, column or diagonal wins. I advise preparing multiple sets of goals in advance if you intend to do multiple rounds.
